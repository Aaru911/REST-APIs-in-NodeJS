# REST-APIs-in-NodeJS
The REST-APIs-in-NodeJS project is a web development project that showcases the creation of a RESTful API using Node.js. This project demonstrates how to build an API from scratch using modern web development tools and techniques.
The API uses a Node.js server to handle HTTP requests and responses, with data stored in a MongoDB database. It includes endpoints for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of resources. The project also utilizes best practices in API design, such as proper error handling and versioning.
This project is a great starting point for developers looking to learn how to build RESTful APIs using Node.js. The code is well-organized and well-documented, making it easy to understand and modify to fit your specific needs.
